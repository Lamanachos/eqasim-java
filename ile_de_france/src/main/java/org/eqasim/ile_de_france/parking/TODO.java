	 * 
	 * Consistency
	 * - ParkingPredictor does not take into account 8h for last activity
	 * 
	 * Cleanup model
	 * - Walk and bike should just depend on Euclidean distance
	 * 
	 * Cleanup code
	 * - Maybe delete IDFSpatial stuff
	 * - Rename travelTime for car to inVehicleTravelTime
	 * 
	 * - Move some elements (lambdaTravelTime) to the general choice model
	 * - Clarify variable names in general choice model
